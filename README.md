# 🧪 Home Lab – Kania

Hi! I'm Kania – a young IT enthusiast experimenting with servers, networking, and automation in my personal home lab. This repository is my digital lab notebook where I store configs, scripts, notes, and cheat sheets that help me build and maintain my own infrastructure.

## 🛠️ What You'll Find Here

- Linux system configurations (mostly Debian/Fedora)
- Bash, PowerShell, and YAML scripts (Docker, Ansible, etc.)
- Proxmox: clustering, HA, VLANs, notes
- Networking setups with Tailscale, AdGuard, UniFi, Pi-hole
- Learning notes and experiment logs
- External references and helpful links

## 📌 Purpose

This is not a polished, production-ready project – it's a **learning sandbox and documentation hub**. If something here helps you – awesome! If it breaks – even better. That's how we learn 🚀
